## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site: <https://suite-landing-page-nmrqcs7js-victorduranem.vercel.app/>
- Source Code: <https://github.com/VictorDuranEM/suite-landing-page>

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [CVA](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva) - CSS-in-JS library
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had some more practice with CSS using Tailwind and I feel and getting better and faster at coming up with approaches to display the required components in the screen.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to include data fetching to learn how to use the getStaticProps and getServerSideProps functions. I might start trying other frameworks too, like Astro and Solidjs.
